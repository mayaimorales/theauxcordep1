# The Aux Cord Ep. 1: Welcome to the Show

## Introduction

#### What's up everyone! I am your host, Maya Morales and Welcome to the first ever episode of The Aux Cord! 

#### "I have had this idea in the works for a long time but have never had the balls to do it until now. My professor has given us an interactive project assignment and this is it! I couldn't be more excited though and I plan to continue this beyond the semester as long as people enjoy it!"

#### In this podcast I am going to be talking about different music and pop culture. I truly believe that music brings all different types of people together, even the most unlikely people! Once you have a common song that you both like, you are instantly connected. Music allows people to relate to eachother's situations, evokes emotions that people can connect on and I want to talk about and showcase that.  Each week we will have a theme and a playlist will be created and linked for everyone to access. I will be going through the playlist and dissecting the songs and giving the viewers a chance to give their own opinions as well. Then I will jump into a pop culture segment for a brief period afterwards to discuss a popular topic in pop culture that week! With all that being said, let's jump into it!
